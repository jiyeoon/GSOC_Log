## Make a benchmarks

![img](assets/img/week5/img1.png)

In this week, I got the inference latency time for each model with a small dataset. (under 40 samples)

As a result of checking roughly, the value of latency changed the most according to input shape, and the filter size also affected it a lot.

And now I'm currently making larger dataset with below's combinations.

```python
kernel_list = [2*i+1 for i in range(3)]                     # 1, 3, 5
filter_list = [2**i for i in range(4, 8)]                   # 16, 32, 64, 128
input_img_list = [(2*i, 2*i, 3) for i in range(32, 112)]    # 64, 68, ...., 224
```



## To Check List

- [ ] What is exactly mean input channel?
- [ ] Simple regression
  - How to make simple regression? 
  - $$ latency = ax_1 + bx_2 + cx_3 + .... + k_n x_n $$ 
  - $x_n$ : one layer's latency time
  - $k_n$ : constant (?)
- [ ] CSV to SQLite?
  - Still working on csv.... 
  - I'm just thinking of saving all the results in csv first and then making a database later.
