### Add columns on database

![img](assets/img/week6/img1.png)

I got more database samples by adding padding and stride columns and putting various input shape. 

### Initial version of regression model

In this week, I tried to make simple regression model using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library in python. 

```python
# data preprocessing
import os
import re
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

file_path = "./result3.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

tmp = df['input_shape'].str.replace('(', '').str.replace(')', '').str.split(',')

df['input_channel'] = tmp.str.get(0)
df['input_hw'] = tmp.str.get(1)
df['padding'] = np.where(df['padding'] == 'same', 1, 0)
```

Code ofr Simple Linear Regression model

R2(R-squared) score is 0.24032520601123475....


### To Check List

- [x] start github repo
  - <https://github.com/jiyeoon/GSOC_proj>
  - It's a little bit messy 
- [ ] EDA
- [ ] Data Preprocessing 
  - Normalize or ...
- [ ] Metric
  - R2 score is good enough? 
- [ ] Regression model
  - There are various kinds of regression models like decision tree regressor, linear regressor, random-forest regressor...
